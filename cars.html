				<h3>My Favorite Formula One Drivers</h3>
			</article>

			<article class="mart2">
				<h4 style="color:blue"><b>Fernando Alonso</b></h4>
				<img src="Images\04.png" alt="Fernando Alonso photo" width="220" height="130">
				<p>My favorite F1 driver is Fernando Alonso, who is a Spanish racing driver currently competing for team Alpine in Formula One. He won the series World Drivers Championship in 2005 and 2006 with team Renault. I followed Fernando Alonso since my first contact with Formula One back in 2006. He is my favorite driver for all time because of his strong defensive skills, straight-forward personality inside the paddock, as well as the fact that he official ended the era dominated by Ferrari and Schumacher.</p>

				<h4 style="color:blue"><b>Guanyu Zhou</b></h4>
				<img src="Images\05.jpg" alt="Guanyu Zhou photo" width="210" height="120">	
				<p>My latest favorite driver is Guanyu Zhou, who is a Chinese racing driver who currently competing for team Alfa Romeo in Formula One. One big reason I like Guanyu Zhou is because he is from Shanghai, which is also my hometown, and he is the first ever Chinese racing driver to compete in Formula One. Of course, Guanyu also shows great talent and pace as a rookie, which he has earned 6 points in his first ever F1 season.</p>
