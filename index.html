				<p>Hi, I am Zhetao (Matt) Chen. I'm from Shanghai, China and I'm currently live in Madison, WI. I am a junior majoring in <a href="https://guide.wisc.edu/undergraduate/human-ecology/consumer-science/consumer-behavior-marketplace-studies-bs/">Consumer Behavior & Marketplace Studies</a> with an ongoing Design Strategy certificate at UW Madison. I am interested in the retailing industry because I found it fascinating to discover the demands and trends of different products & services, as well as how brands integrate their culture into every aspect of retail. Outside my student life, I like sailing and I'm also a car enthusiast, in which I love researching about cars, collecting scale models, and watching Formula One in my spare time.</p>

				<p>I've worked as an intern salesperson at Fande BMW, the largest authorized dealer of BMW Group in Shanghai, in summer 2021, learning detailed information about automotive retailing, supply chain, as well as the future trends of the industry. Currently, I am working as a language (Mandarin) tutor under Greater University Tutoring Services's <a href="https://guts.wisc.edu/wll/">WLL</a> Division.</p>
